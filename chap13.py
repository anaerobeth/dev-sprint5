#This is where the answers to Chapter 13 questions for the BSS Dev RampUp go
# Name: Elizabeth Tenorio

#1. Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov analysis.
# The result should be a dictionary that maps from prefixes to a collection of possible suffixes.



#2. Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based
#on the Markov analysis.



#3. 3. Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up:
# if you analyze text from two or more books, the random text you generate will
#blend the vocabulary and phrases from the sources in interesting ways
